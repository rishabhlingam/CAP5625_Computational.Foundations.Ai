Implemented classical Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression, L1 & L2 penalized Linear Regression, ElasticNet, Logistic Regression, L1 & L2 penalized Logistic Regression, Gradient Decent, Mini Batch Gradient Decent, Coordinate Decent and K-folds Cross Validation algorithms. This project not only honed my programming skills but also helped me translate theoretical concepts into functional models, gained insight into the nuances of machine learning algorithms and build a strong and solid foundations.
